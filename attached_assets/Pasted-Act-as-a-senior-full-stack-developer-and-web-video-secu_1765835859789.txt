Act as a senior full-stack developer and web video security specialist.
I have an existing paid video / movie streaming website and I want to update it with strong anti-recording and anti-theft protection.

MAIN RULES

Users can watch videos only.
Downloading, copying, recording, or extracting video links must be prevented as much as possible.

If a user tries to record, screen share, inspect source code, open DevTools, copy video links, or behave suspiciously, the system must:

Immediately pause or close the video

Log the violation in the database

Automatically ban the user (temporary or permanent)

Apply spam protection and time limits

FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS (React / JavaScript)

Use HLS (.m3u8) streaming only (NO direct MP4 links).

Hide all real video URLs:

No video link visible in HTML

No static video URLs in source code

Video loaded only via secure API with expiring token

Block user actions:

Disable right-click menu

Disable text selection

Disable copy, save, view source, and inspect shortcuts

Prevent “Copy video address”

Auto-stop video when:

Browser tab is hidden or user switches tab

Screen sharing or browser recording is attempted

Developer tools are opened

Add dynamic watermark overlay on video:

User ID

Current timestamp

Random moving position

BACKEND REQUIREMENTS

Serve video streams via token-based access:

Tokens must expire

Tokens tied to user ID and IP/device

Violation system:

Screen share / recording attempt → Permanent ban

DevTools or inspect attempt → Permanent ban

2+ tab switches → 24-hour temporary ban

Repeated violations → Account locked

Spam & time limits:

Limit daily watch time (example: 3 hours/day)

Limit number of play attempts per hour

Session & device control:

1 account = 1 device/session

New login terminates old session

SECURITY & UX RULES

Show warning message before playback:

“Recording, copying, or redistribution is prohibited. Violations will result in automatic ban.”

If user is banned:

Immediately stop stream

Block access to all video APIs

OUTPUT REQUIRED

Updated frontend code 

Updated backend logic

Database schema for:

Violations

Ban status

Watch time tracking

Clear explanation of auto-ban, spam control, and time-limit logic

Follow real-world streaming platform security practices.
Do NOT claim 100% recording prevention, only realistic protection.

My goal is to make video theft difficult, traceable, and punishable automatically.
