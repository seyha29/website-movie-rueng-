Verify Transaction Success
In order to ensure the success of a transaction, you will need to invoke the checking API to verify its status. By making this call, you can confirm whether the transaction was successful or not.

*** You must call verify transactions on the backend side only; never validate them in JavaScript.

<?php
    $payment_verify_url = "https://raksmeypay.com/api/payment/verify/5eebfa4ea9e0f54a55bd13e19e3fae84";
    $profile_key = "YOUR_PROFILE_KEY"; //Replace with your Profile Key
    $transaction_id = 12345678; // Replace with your transaction ID
    $transaction_amount = 0.01; // Replace with your transaction amount
    $hash = sha1($profile_key . $transaction_id);
    $data = [
        "transaction_id" => $transaction_id,
        "hash" => $hash
    ];
    $ch = curl_init();
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $payment_verify_url);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
    $response = curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);
    $response = json_decode($response, 1);
    // Ensure that the Payment Status and Payment Amount are correctly validated to match your transaction.
    if(!empty($response["payment_status"])
        && strtoupper($response["payment_status"]) == "SUCCESS"
        && $response["payment_amount"] == $transaction_amount){
        //code to handle payment success
        // *** Proper validation is necessary on your side to prevent the service from being provided more than once.
        echo "payment success";
    }
